# finalProject
"Sneaker shop" website with fake API This file is our final project from the "WEB Technology Course". Our project is about "Sneackers shop". WE had to create fake api using mockend. In order to create the fake API first we created new respiratory on GITHUB. After we wrote the file name and created new file. So, after we wrote our mockend or in other words we created arrays. So after we named it as "db.jsob" and commited the changes. Finally we finished and puted the link.
Our fake API: https://my-json-server.typicode.com/Overexm/mockjsonf
